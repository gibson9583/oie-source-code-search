## Requirements

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| OIE Version | 4.6.0+ |
| Java | 17+ |

## Installation

Download the latest release ZIP from the [Releases](https://github.com/diridium-com/oie-source-code-search/releases) page and install it through the OIE Administrator plugin manager.

## Building from Source

The public repsy mirror at `repo.repsy.io/mvn/kpalang/mirthconnect` does not yet carry the 4.6.0 engine artifacts. Build the engine (`ant` in `donkey/` then `server/`) from a sibling checkout, then run:

```
ENGINE_DIR=/path/to/engine ./scripts/install-engine-jars.sh
mvn verify
```

The script installs `mirth-server`, `donkey-server`, `mirth-client-core`, and `mirth-client` at version 4.6.0 into your local Maven repository. If `ENGINE_DIR` is unset, it defaults to `../engine` relative to this repo.
